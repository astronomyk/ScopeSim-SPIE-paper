Outline
-------
- IRDB
    - Data pertaining to an instrument
    - Custom Effects
    - Scalable level of complexity
        - ETC
        - Clean (science grade) simulated data
        - Dirty (pipeline grade) simulated data
    - Reusable components
        - Primary packages (instrument)
        - Support packages (telescope, atmosphere, relay optics)
    - YAML based human readable configuration files (extended json)
        - Observing mode support
        - default.yaml
        - <instrument_name>.yaml
        - <observing_mode>.yaml
        - descriptions of effects
            - contains class name - must be valid class from scopesim.effects
            - passes keyword-value dictionary using **kwargs from yaml
    - Data needed by each Effect
        - Provided directly in YAML file
        - ASCII of FITS file pointer in YAML file
        - Examples: Transmission curves, PSF images, spectrscopic trace geometry
    - Set data format interface between Effects and data files
    - Test suite connected to Travis-CI to verify correct data format
